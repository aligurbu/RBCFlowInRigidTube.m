# RBCFlowInRigidTube.m: Red blood cell motion and deformation inside of a rigid tube with varying cross-section.

- This code was developed for part of [my dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355033649_Simulations_of_Red_Blood_Cell_Flow_by_Boundary_Integral_Methods) to simulate red blood cell flow using boundary integral methods.
- This repository contains the code for the examples presented in Chapter 6 for simulating the red blood cell motion and deformation in a microcapillary with constriction.
